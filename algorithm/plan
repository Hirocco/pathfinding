1. **Function Signature**:
   - Confirm the function signature `std::vector<Coordinate> shortestPath();` in your header file.

2. **Initialize Data Structures**:
   - Create a 2D vector `distances` to hold distances from the start node, initialized to infinity, except for the start node which should be 0.
   - Define a priority queue to hold nodes based on their current distance, prioritizing the smallest distances first.
   - Create a 2D vector `predecessor` to keep track of the path, indicating which node you came from to reach the current node.

3. **Implement Priority Queue Logic**:
   - Push the start node into the priority queue with a distance of 0.
   - Implement the main loop that continues as long as the priority queue is not empty, processing nodes by increasing distance.

4. **Processing Nodes**:
   - While the priority queue is not empty:
     - Pop the node with the smallest distance from the queue.
     - If it's the destination node, you can use the `predecessor` vector to reconstruct the path.
     - For each unvisited neighbor (up, down, left, right):
       - Calculate the potential new distance (current node's distance + 1).
       - If the new distance is less than the neighbor's recorded distance in `distances`:
         - Update the neighbor's distance.
         - Update the neighbor's `predecessor`.
         - Add the neighbor to the priority queue.

5. **Reconstruct the Shortest Path**:
   - Once you reach the finish node, use the `predecessor` vector to backtrack from the finish node to the start node to reconstruct the path.
   - Push the nodes onto a stack or a vector as you backtrack.
   - Reverse the order to get the path from start to finish.

6. **Return the Path**:
   - Return the vector containing the shortest path from the start node to the finish node.

7. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Test your function with a simple scenario to ensure it's working as expected.
   - Gradually increase complexity by adding more nodes and obstacles (if applicable).
   - Validate the correctness of the path returned by visualizing it or comparing it with known results.

8. **Refinement and Optimization**:
   - After ensuring the correctness, you can look for ways to optimize your code.
   - Consider edge cases and add error handling where necessary.
