## Project Description
The Pathfinding project is a comprehensive tool for visualizing and understanding various pathfinding algorithms. This project lets you interactively explore how different algorithms work and compare their efficiency in finding the shortest path between two points.

## Features
The Pathfinding project supports several algorithms such as:
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- A* Search
- Breadth-First Search
- Depth-First Search
- (Add other algorithms supported)

## Installation
To install and run the project, follow these steps:

Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/Hirocco/pathfinding.git

Go into the repository: cd pathfinding

## Usage
After you run the code, grid will pop out. Press S to sleect starting point, F for finish point and press your left button on mouse to create walls. 
To run Djikstra's algorithm, press D, to run BFS algorithm press B.

## Contribution
We welcome contributions from the community. If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and make changes as you'd like. Pull requests are warmly welcome.
